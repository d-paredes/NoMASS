The No-\/\+M\+A\+S\+S-\/\+G\+UI is a standalone tool that enable the No-\/\+M\+A\+SS framework in building energy performance simulation tools such as Energy\+Plus. For more details about the No-\/\+M\+A\+SS framework (models of occupant interaction and appliance usage) refer to the No-\/\+M\+A\+SS framework documentation.

The No-\/\+M\+A\+SS framework relies on the fractional radiation transmitted through windows considering the proportion that shading devices are closed to enable interaction with shading devices. Energy\+Plus source code has been altered to allow the No-\/\+M\+A\+SS access this estimate at each timestep during the co-\/simulation using the standard Functional Mock-\/\+Up Interface (F\+MI).

The modified source code has to be compiled to generate an executable version of Energy\+Plus for the platform where building simulations are run. The process to build Energy\+Plus on all platforms can be found at \href{https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/wiki/BuildingEnergyPlus}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/\+N\+R\+E\+L/\+Energy\+Plus/wiki/\+Building\+Energy\+Plus}. However, Energy\+Plus does not support F\+MI on Mac OS.
