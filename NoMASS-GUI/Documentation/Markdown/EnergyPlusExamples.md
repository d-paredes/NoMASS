# EnergyPlus Examples                       {#EnergyPlusExamples}

## Example 1: Shoe box configuration file

The following example enables No-MASS to run a non-residential building configuration.

* A building is defined
  * Two agents are working in the building and assigned to the only zone
  * Both agents have the same presence profile, have equal power and use the same shade and window model
